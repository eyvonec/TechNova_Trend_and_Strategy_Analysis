## Deep Dive Insights
### Trend Analysis
In March 2020, a 46.2% increase order counts 50.3% increase in total sales, the highest monthly growth rates across 2019-2022, suggest pandemic-driven surge in demand, particularly for items like monitors, headphones, and laptops; while a significant dip in October 2022 by -46.88% in total order counts and -55.2% in total sales may reflect market shifts or economic pressures.

Seasonal trends are evident, with November and December consistently recording the highest growth (likely due to holiday shopping) followed by a downturn in the surrounding months.

Comparing total sales, order count, and average order value (AOV) reveals that sales and order counts generally correlate, meaning that when more orders are placed, total sales tend to rise proportionally. However, AOV sometimes moves in the opposite direction, indicating shifts in customer purchasing behavior.

For example, there are periods (like Janurary 2020) when customers favor higher-value purchases, leading to an increase in AOV (Jan 2020 AOV grew by 12.97%) even when order count remains stable or declines (Jan 2020 order count declined by -11.28%). Conversely, in December 2019, AOV declined by 6.71%, while order count increased by 19.08% and total sales grew by 11%. This suggests that although more orders were placed, they were for lower-priced items on average, highlighting how AOV can diverge from the overall sales trend

Additionally, the data shows that 2019 and 2020 experienced more prominent growth spikes, whereas 2021 and 2022 saw more frequent declines. This shift could be attributed to factors such as post-pandemic market saturation, inflation, or the inherently less frequent nature of electronics purchases compared to essentials.

### Geographic Distribution
TechNova's total sales are primarily concentrated in English-speaking countries, with the U.S. leading, followed by Great Britain and Canada. Although the overall sales distribution among the top 10 countries remained consistent from 2019 to 2022, the pandemic year of 2020 saw an increase in total sales across the top 10 countries (especially US had total sales over $4.8 M USD), reflecting a global surge in demand for electronic devices. 

![Sheet 4 (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/236f96c0-ecfc-4326-b01e-904998090df4)

The main regions for TechNova's total sales are North America, followed by EMEA. TechNova should consider expanding the market to APAC, which is ranked the thrid on total sales. APAC has the highest AOV (average order value) from Feb 2020 onward most of the time, indicating a strong purchasing power and a willingness to spend more per transaction. LATAM performed the worst in terms of both total sales and AOV. However, there was an unusual surge in AOV from Nov. 2019 to Jan. 2020. Especially in Jan 2020, the AOV is about $400 USD, outperforming the 2nd rank, $264 USD in North America. It's also worth to note the unusual dip of LATAM AOV from Jan. to Sep. 2022, during which the AOV were barely over $200 USD.

### Star Products 
Among all the products, Apple Airpods are the most popular from 2019 to 2022 contributed to an average 45% of the total order counts across the years, following by monitors and cables, which occupied about an average of 20% of the total order counts each. 

The huge number of total orders of Apple Airpods contributed about 30% of the total sales throughout the years, which is ranked at the 2nd place in terms of the % of the total sales. The gaming monitors contributed the most (about 40%) in terms of the total sales across the years. Both MacBooks (~20%) and ThinkPad laptops (~10%) ranked as 3rd and 4th in terms of the % of the total sales while both items only contributed less than 5% in terms of the total order counts. It's also worth noting that in 2020, when the pandemic began, there was an increase for MacBooks. 

Apple Airpods and gaming monitors are the first and second contributors to the sales of TechNova.

### Marketing Channel
The direct method seems to be the most effective and contributes around 80% of the total sales and total order counts throughout the years, following by email, which contributes around 12% total sales and 17% total counts. 

Regarding the effectiveness of each marketing channel to products, the affiliate program seems to work extremely well for gaming monitors, 35% of the total order counts. The effectiveness of affiliate on products is also relevantly even. Considering the total orders for Apple Airpods are the highest regardless of any marketing channel, affiliate can be viewed as the most effective way of marketing. Social media shall be ranked as the 2nd in terms of effectiveness as more types of product orders are coming through it. In addition, emails worked surprisingly well with Samsung Webcam (15% of total order count).

### Refund Rate 
The number of refunds across the months shows a positive relationship between the number of orders and the number of refunds. For the most popular product, Apple Airpods, while taking an average 45% of the total monthly orders, Airpods occupied about 50% of the refunds every month. However, starting from Aug 2021 onwards, there was no refund, which is likely caused by missing data. Additionally, it’s worth noting that Bose Headphones recorded almost zero refunds across all years. This exceptional performance invites further investigation into the factors driving such positive results.

![Sheet 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a283b3-dc3b-44d4-9184-90b34c95c336)

In general, the refund rates for MacBooks and ThinkPad Laptops are higher (around 0.2) comparing to the other products throughout 2019 to 2021 (there is no data from Aug 2021 onwards). On the other hand, iPhones have the highest fluctuation and several notable spikes in refund rates. For instance, in 2019 Q2, 2020 Q3, and 2021 Q1, iPhones have refund rate about 0.2 while in 2019 Q1, 2020 Q1, and 2020 Q4, the refund rates are around 0.05.

### Loyalty Program

#### Total Sales:
Non-loyalty typically has a higher total order count overall, but an important crossover happens in March 2021, where loyalty’s total sales catch up and then slightly surpass non-loyalty. This suggests that the loyalty segment’s purchase volume and/or frequency grew sufficiently to drive higher overall sales from March 2021 through mid/late 2022. 

#### Average Order Value (AOV):
For most of the observed period (2019–2022), non-loyalty customers exhibit a higher AOV than loyalty customers. This could mean that while non-loyalty shoppers spend more per transaction, they might be less frequent purchasers. An exception emerges around June 2021 onward, where loyalty AOV narrows the gap or surpasses non-loyalty AOV. This fluctuation hints that either loyalty customers were encouraged to buy higher-priced items or that promotional strategies specifically boosted their spending during those months.

![Sheet 14-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ac5bd84-10db-4002-bd2c-a5c19b103240)

#### Loyalty Join Rate by Product:
From 2019 to mid-2021, the loyalty join rate for key products (e.g., gaming monitors, Apple devices, and Samsung accessories) showed a clear upward trend. This rise indicates successful recruitment efforts or appealing loyalty perks during that timeframe.

Post-mid-2021, a downward trend in join rates emerges, suggesting possible market saturation, waning promotional impact, or program fatigue. This decline might call for revamping the loyalty program or introducing fresh incentives to maintain and grow membership.

### Recommendations:

#### **1. Sales and Seasonal Strategy Optimization**
- **Capitalize on Peak Demand Periods:**  
  The significant pandemic-driven surge in March 2020 and consistent sales spikes in November and December highlight strong seasonal demand. TechNova should expand holiday promotions, bundle deals, and targeted marketing campaigns to maximize conversions during these high-growth months.  

- **Mitigate Post-Holiday Sales Dips:**  
  The notable downturns after peak seasons (e.g., October 2022: -46.88% in orders, -55.2% in sales) suggest the need for post-holiday retention campaigns, such as targeted discounts for repeat customers, exclusive loyalty offers, and early-bird deals for upcoming product launches.  

#### **2. Geographic Expansion and Market Focus**
- **Expand in APAC for High-AOV Opportunities:**  
  APAC consistently shows the highest AOV post- May 2020, signaling strong spending power. Localized marketing campaigns, partnerships, and regional pricing strategies should be implemented to drive higher adoption in APAC markets.  

- **Analyze LATAM Market Decline:**  
  LATAM has the lowest total sales and AOV, but the unusual AOV surge in early 2020 suggests an opportunity for premium pricing during specific demand periods. Investigating regional economic conditions and purchasing trends could inform targeted sales strategies.  

- **Enhance Personalization in the U.S. & Canada:**  
  As TechNova's strongest markets, the U.S. and Canada should be leveraged for personalized product recommendations, exclusive VIP loyalty tiers, and segmented promotions to drive repeat purchases.  

#### **3. Product Strategy and Inventory Planning**
- **Expand High-Margin Laptop Sales:**  
  Despite MacBooks (~20% of total sales) and ThinkPads (~10%) having lower order counts (<5%), their high-value contribution suggests potential for premium marketing strategies, student/work-from-home bundles, and extended warranty upsells.  

- **Leverage Refund Insights to Improve Customer Satisfaction:**  
  The higher refund rates for MacBooks and ThinkPads (~0.2) vs. near-zero refunds for Bose Headphones indicate that there is a need to study the causes of this discrepency to improve the product description, post-purchase support, and quality guarantees, which could enhance customer retention and trust.


#### **4. Marketing Channel Optimization**
- **Strengthen Direct Sales & Affiliate Programs:**  
  Direct sales drive 80% of orders, making them TechNova’s most effective channel. However, affiliate marketing (35% of orders for gaming monitors) has shown high product-specific effectiveness. Expanding affiliate partnerships, influencer marketing, and tech review collaborations can drive additional sales in key product categories.  

- **Boost Social Media-Driven Orders:**  
  Social media ranks second in marketing effectiveness due to its influence on multiple product categories. Further investments in social commerce, short-form video promotions (TikTok, Instagram Reels), and influencer partnerships can expand reach.  

- **Enhance Email Targeting for Product-Specific Gains:**  
  Samsung Webcams performed best through email marketing (15% of orders), showing that email is effective for targeted product promotions. Refining email segmentation, abandoned cart reminders, and exclusive discount campaigns can improve overall sales.


#### **5. Loyalty Program Enhancements**
- **Address Declining Loyalty Join Rates Post-2021:**  
  The drop in loyalty membership growth after mid-2021 suggests potential program fatigue or market saturation. TechNova should introduce fresh incentives or experiential rewards (early access to deals, exclusive tech workshops, etc.) to re-engage loyalty customers.  

- **Leverage Loyalty AOV Crossover (2021) for Premium Upsells:**  
  The March 2021 crossover in total sales between loyalty and non-loyalty members signals that loyalty members have become more frequent and high-value buyers. Offering exclusive high-margin bundles, VIP early access to new products, and personalized rewards can further maximize revenue and maintain the loyalty of customers.  

- **Improve Loyalty Retention Post-2022 Drop:**  
  As loyalty-driven sales declined in late 2022, TechNova should analyze potential reasons such as less attractive rewards, changes in customer expectations, or shifts in pricing strategy. A customer survey or behavioral data analysis could help refine loyalty engagement strategies.
