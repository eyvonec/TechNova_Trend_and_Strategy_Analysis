## Deep Dive Insights
### Trend Analysis
In March 2020, a 46.2% increase order counts 50.3% increase in total sales, the highest monthly growth rates across 2019-2022, suggest pandemic-driven surge in demand, particularly for items like monitors, headphones, and laptops; while a significant dip in October 2022 by -46.88% in total order counts and -55.2% in total sales may reflect market shifts or economic pressures.

Seasonal trends are evident, with November and December consistently recording the highest growth (likely due to holiday shopping) followed by a downturn in the surrounding months.

Comparing total sales, order count, and average order value (AOV) reveals that sales and order counts generally correlate, meaning that when more orders are placed, total sales tend to rise proportionally. However, AOV sometimes moves in the opposite direction, indicating shifts in customer purchasing behavior.

For example, there are periods (like Janurary 2020) when customers favor higher-value purchases, leading to an increase in AOV (Jan 2020 AOV grew by 12.97%) even when order count remains stable or declines (Jan 2020 order count declined by -11.28%). Conversely, in December 2019, AOV declined by 6.71%, while order count increased by 19.08% and total sales grew by 11%. This suggests that although more orders were placed, they were for lower-priced items on average, highlighting how AOV can diverge from the overall sales trend

Additionally, the data shows that 2019 and 2020 experienced more prominent growth spikes, whereas 2021 and 2022 saw more frequent declines. This shift could be attributed to factors such as post-pandemic market saturation, inflation, or the inherently less frequent nature of electronics purchases compared to essentials.

### Geographic Distribution
TechNova's total sales are primarily concentrated in English-speaking countries, with the U.S. leading, followed by Great Britain and Canada. Although the overall sales distribution among the top 10 countries remained consistent from 2019 to 2022, the pandemic year of 2020 saw an increase in total sales across the top 10 countries (especially US had total sales over $4.8 M USD), reflecting a global surge in demand for electronic devices. 

![Sheet 4 (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/236f96c0-ecfc-4326-b01e-904998090df4)

The main regions for TechNova's total sales are North America, followed by EMEA. TechNova should consider expanding the market to APAC, which is ranked the thrid on total sales. APAC has the highest AOV (average order value) from Feb 2020 onward most of the time, indicating a strong purchasing power and a willingness to spend more per transaction. LATAM performed the worst in terms of both total sales and AOV. However, there was an unusual surge in AOV from Nov. 2019 to Jan. 2020. Especially in Jan 2020, the AOV is about $400 USD, outperforming the 2nd rank, $264 USD in North America. It's also worth to note the unusual dip of LATAM AOV from Jan. to Sep. 2022, during which the AOV were barely over $200 USD.

### Star Products 
Among all the products, Apple Airpods are the most popular from 2019 to 2022 contributed to an average 45% of the total order counts across the years, following by monitors and cables, which occupied about an average of 20% of the total order counts each. 

The huge number of total orders of Apple Airpods contributed about 30% of the total sales throughout the years, which is ranked at the 2nd place in terms of the % of the total sales. The gaming monitors contributed the most (about 40%) in terms of the total sales across the years. Both MacBooks (~20%) and ThinkPad laptops (~10%) ranked as 3rd and 4th in terms of the % of the total sales while both items only contributed less than 5% in terms of the total order counts. It's also worth noting that in 2020, when the pandemic began, there was an increase for MacBooks. 

Apple Airpods and gaming monitors are the first and second contributors to the sales of TechNova.

### Refund Rate 
The area graph on the % of the number of refunds across the months shows a positive relationship between the number of orders and the number of refunds. For the most popular product, Apple Airpods, while taking an average 45% of the total monthly orders, Airpods occupied about 50% of the refunds every month. However, starting from Aug 2021 onwards, there was no refund, which is likely caused by missing data. Additionally, it’s worth noting that Bose Headphones recorded almost zero refunds across all four years. This exceptional performance invites further investigation into the factors driving such positive results.

![Sheet 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a283b3-dc3b-44d4-9184-90b34c95c336)

In general, the refund rates for MacBooks and ThinkPad Laptops are higher (around 0.2) comparing to the other products throughout 2019 to 2021 (there is no data from Aug 2021 onwards). On the other hand, iPhones have the highest fluctuation and several notable spikes in refund rates. For instance, in 2019 Q2, 2020 Q3, and 2021 Q1, iPhones have refund rate about 0.2 while in 2019 Q1, 2020 Q1, and 2020 Q4, the refund rates are around 0.05.

### Loyalty Program

#### Total Order Count & Total Sales:
Non-loyalty typically has a higher total order count overall, but an important crossover happens in March 2021, where loyalty’s total sales catch up and then slightly surpass non-loyalty.
This suggests that although non-loyalty customers place more orders on average, the loyalty segment’s purchase volume and/or frequency grew sufficiently to drive higher overall sales from March 2021 through mid/late 2022. Likely factors include targeted promotions, improved loyalty benefits, or a successful acquisition campaign that converted existing shoppers into loyal program members.

#### Average Order Value (AOV):
For most of the observed period (2019–2022), non-loyalty customers exhibit a higher AOV than loyalty customers. This could mean that while non-loyalty shoppers spend more per transaction, they might be less frequent purchasers. An exception emerges around early 2021 onward, where loyalty AOV occasionally narrows the gap or briefly surpasses non-loyalty AOV. This fluctuation hints that either loyalty customers were encouraged to buy higher-priced items or that promotional strategies specifically boosted their spending during those months.

#### Loyalty Join Rate by Product:
From 2019 to mid-2021, the loyalty join rate for key products (e.g., gaming monitors, Apple devices, and Samsung accessories) showed a clear upward trend. This rise indicates successful recruitment efforts or appealing loyalty perks during that timeframe.

Post-mid-2021, a downward trend in join rates emerges, suggesting possible market saturation, waning promotional impact, or program fatigue. This decline might call for revamping the loyalty program or introducing fresh incentives to maintain and grow membership.

#### Overall Program Implications:
The data points to growing importance of loyalty customers—they may spend less per order on average but still generate significant total revenue due to increased frequency or volume.
The crossover in total sales around March 2021 is particularly telling: loyalty became a critical revenue driver. Maintaining that momentum may require addressing the recent drop in join rates, whether through new tiers, personalized offers, or enhanced rewards.

In summary, loyalty’s lower AOV is offset by higher order volume, leading to a notable sales advantage from March 2021 onward. However, to sustain this performance, investigating membership growth and engagement will be essential—especially in light of the join-rate decline after mid-2021.

### Marketing Channel
The direct method seems to be the most effective and contributes around 80% of the total sales and total order counts throughout the years, following by email, which contributes around 12% total sales and 17% total counts.

Regarding the effectiveness of each marketing channel to products, the affiliate program seems to work extremely well for gaming monitors, 35% of the total order counts. The effectiveness of affiliate on products is also relevantly even. Considering the total orders for Apple Airpods are the highest regardless of any marketing channel, affiliate can be viewed as the most effective way of marketing. Social media shall be ranked as the 2nd in terms of effectiveness as more types of product orders are coming through it. In addition, emails worked surprisingly well with Samsung Webcam (15% of total order count).
